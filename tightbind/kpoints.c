 *
 *                   Procedure loop_over_k_points
 *
 * Arguments:  cell: pointer to cell type
 *          details: pointer to detail type
 *          overlapR: hermetian_matrix_type
 *            hamilR: hermetian_matrix_type
 *          overlapK: hermetian_matrix_type
 *            hamilK: hermetian_matrix_type
 *   cmplx_hamil, cmplx_overlap: pointers to complex
 *          eigenset: eigenset_type
 *        properties: pointer to prop_type
 *     avg_prop_info: pointer to avg_prop_info_type
 * work1,work2,work3: pointers to reals
 *        cmplx_work: pointer to complex
 *          num_orbs: int
 * orbital_lookup_table: pointer to int.
 *
 * Returns: none
 *
 * Action:  Loops over all the k-points for this run.  At each k-point the following
 *     things are done:
 *    - Generate the K space overlap and hamiltonian matrices.
 *    - solve the eigenvalue eqn:
 *      H(k) * Y = S(k) * E * Y
 *    - do any required calculations for this k-point (properties, etc.)
 *    - write any required info to the output file
 *
 *   Some helpful definitions:
 *
 *
 *              N                     |              N
 *            -----                   |            -----
 *             \                      |             \
 *    H(k) :=   )   exp(-i k . r) H(r)|    S(k) :=   )   exp(-i k . r) S(r)
 *             /                      |             /
 *            -----                   |            -----
 *            r = 1                   |            r = 1
 *                                    |
 *                                    |
 *
 *   The work arrays are used as temporary memory in the various functions called
 *    by this one.  The dimensions should be:
 *         work1,work2: num_orbs;
 *    work3,cmplx_work: num_orbs*num_orbs;
