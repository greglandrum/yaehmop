*                   Procedure find_princ_axes
*
* Arguments:  atoms:  pointer to atom_type
*              locs:  pointer to point_type
*        princ_axes:  a 3x3 matrix of reals
*           moments:  a 3-vector of reals
*         num_atoms:  integer
*
* Returns: none
*
* Action:  builds the inertia tensor and diagonalizes it to find the principle
*    axes, which are returned in 'princ_axes.
*
*  NOTE: in order for this to give physically meaningful results, it is important
*   to translate the atoms to center of mass coordinates first.
