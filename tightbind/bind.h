  Edit History:

  March 1998, Wingfield Glassey

  - modifications for f orbitals, abfns.c and COHP's

  11.04.98 gL:
   #defines for FATAL_BUG and NONFATAL_BUG added
   version_string changed to 2.5a, for the hell of it... it probably
   should be something like 3.0a, but I can't be bothered.
  07.05.98 gL:
   added netCDF support
   changed atom symbol length from hardcoded 10 to ATOM_SYMB_LEN
  18.08.98 gL:
   check for definition of PI before redefining it please.
  26.09.98 gL:
   added some symmetry storage to detail_type
  12.04.99 gL:
   version string updated to 3.0
