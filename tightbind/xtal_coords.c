*
* Arguments: cell: pointer to cell_type
*       printing: char
*
* Returns: none
*
* Action: converts the atoms stored in 'cell from crystallographic
*   coordinates to cartesian coordinates.
*
*   'printing is used to control whether or not all the coordinates
*    are printed out.
*
*   NOTE:  If this function is called more than once, it is
*     absolutely essential that the atomic locations in 'cell->atoms
*     be updated from 'cell->raw_atoms between calls.  Otherwise the
*     cartesian positions will be converted, which will totally
*     screw things up.  It is theoretically possible for the
*     function to catch this, but it involves way too much work
*     for me.  Just be careful if you use this yourself.
