These are some sample input files for bind that demonstrate a lot of
the features and capabilities of bind.  They include cases for
molecules and extended systems of various dimensionalities.  There
should also be at least one example for each type of geometry
specification and some walsh diagram stuff.  Some of the files include
extracts from the output to allow testing of new installations of the
program.

I'm always looking for more sample input files, please help out by
providing some.  Just include your name and a brief explanation of the
input in a comment towards the beginning.

Thanks
