\chapter{Distributing and Modifying \prog}

You can distribute \prog\ to anybody you like.  It's intended to be
given away.  However, you cannot charge others for the distribution.
We are firm believers in free software, and would like \prog\ to
remain freeware.

The programs which make up \prog\ are available in source form.  If
there is a feature lacking which you feel really should be there, feel
free to add it.  If you think that others might like to use this
feature, let us know and we'll see about integrating it into the main
distribution.  This is much easier if you clearly indicate in the
source code where you have made changes and, if possible, send a
context sensitive diff of the modified source files.  If you find and
fix bugs, please do the same thing.
