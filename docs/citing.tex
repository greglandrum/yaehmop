\chapter{Citing \prog}

If you publish calculations and/or figures that you produce using either
\calcprog or \viewprog, we'd appreciate it if you'd cite the program 
in your references section.  
At this point, there are no print publications describing
\prog, so there's no obvious citation to give. \\[0.2in]
