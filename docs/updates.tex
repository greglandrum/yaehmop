\chapter{Updates}

\prog is still under development.  The next version will contain bug fixes
and other great stuff.  If you send us 
email (yaehmop@xtended.chem.cornell.edu) and let us know that you have
the program, we can send you mail and let you know when the next
version is done.  If you don't let us know that you have the program,
you'll just have to keep checking our anonymous ftp site ({\sf
ftp://overlap.chem.cornell.edu/dist/yaehmop}) or the \prog\ home page
on the World Wide Web ({\sf
http://overlap.chem.cornell.edu:8080/yaehmop.html}).
